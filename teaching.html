<h1>Teaching</h1>

<p>
  I have extensive experience in teaching and student mentoring at the university level, progressing from 
  teaching assistant roles to instructor of record positions. My teaching spans applied mathematics, 
  scientific computing, and physics-based modeling across multiple institutions. Throughout my career, 
  I have consistently employed <strong>interactive teaching methods</strong>, emphasizing active learning 
  and student engagement through innovative pedagogical approaches including flipped classroom techniques. 
  My experience encompasses leading lectures, coordinating project work, mentoring undergraduate and 
  graduate research, and developing comprehensive educational materials. Below is a detailed overview of courses I taught with a more detailed breakdown of each course's content, my role, and teaching approach.

  <h2>University of Notre Dame</h2>

  <p>
    As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Notre Dame, I serve as a <strong>co-mentor</strong> 
    for several undergraduate and graduate students, guiding them through research projects in applied 
    scientific computing and engineering. My mentoring approach combines theoretical foundations with 
    practical applications, helping students develop both analytical skills and computational expertise. 
    A comprehensive list of current and completed projects will be added to this website soon.

          The lecture consists of two main areas: Ordinary Differential Equations and Complex Analysis 
          (Funktionentheorie). For ordinary differential equations, important solvability results 
          (e.g., Picard-Lindelöf theorem) as well as solution methods are discussed. In complex analysis, 
          holomorphic functions of one variable are studied and central properties and results of this 
          beautiful theory are presented.
