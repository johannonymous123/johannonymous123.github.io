        <h5>Role and Teaching Approach</h5>
        <p>
          As <strong>instructor of record</strong>, I was responsible for all aspects of the course including 
          holding lectures, maintaining office hours, planning curriculum, and creating and grading all 
          exams, quizzes, and syllabus materials. I implemented many <strong>active learning</strong> and 
          <strong>flipped classroom</strong> techniques, and my students consistently performed 
          <strong>above average</strong> compared to other sections.
        </p>

        <h5>Course Overview</h5>
        <p>
          This course introduces mathematical concepts and techniques used in business and social sciences. 
          The emphasis is on practical applications of finite mathematics including linear algebra, 
          linear programming, and game theory, with particular focus on financial mathematics and 
          decision-making strategies.
        </p>

        <h5>Student Learning Outcomes</h5>
        <p>Upon completion of Math 123, students are able to:</p>

        <p>
          The lecture consists of two main areas: Ordinary Differential Equations and Complex Analysis 
          (Funktionentheorie). For ordinary differential equations, important solvability results 
          (e.g., Picard-Lindelöf theorem) as well as solution methods are discussed. In complex analysis, 
          holomorphic functions of one variable are studied and central properties and results of this 
          beautiful theory are presented.

        <h4>Mathematics for Physicists III (Teaching Assistant)</h4>
        <p><em>University of Konstanz, Winter 2017/18</em></p>

        <h5>Course Content Overview</h5>
        <p>
          This <strong>proof-based</strong> course (taught in German) is part of the mathematics sequence 
          for physics students at the University of Konstanz, taught by <strong>Prof. Dr. Markus Kunze</strong>. 
          The course is offered as an alternative to attending the pure mathematicians' real analysis and 
          linear algebra sequences, specifically tailored for physics students while maintaining mathematical rigor.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lecture consists of two main areas: Ordinary Differential Equations and Complex Analysis 
          (Funktionentheorie). For ordinary differential equations, important solvability results 
          (e.g., Picard-Lindelöf theorem) as well as solution methods are discussed. In complex analysis, 
          holomorphic functions of one variable are studied and central properties and results of this 
          beautiful theory are presented.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the third and final course in the series, building on the foundations established in 
          Mathematics for Physicists I and II. The course provides essential mathematical tools for 
          advanced physics, particularly in quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and theoretical physics.
