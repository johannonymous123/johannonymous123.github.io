  <h2>Project 1: Generative Modeling for Physical Systems</h2>
  <p>
    I investigate how generative models such as normalizing flows and score-based diffusion processes can be adapted to physical systems with strong constraints — such as conservation laws or geometry. The goal is to build physically plausible models for uncertainty quantification and sampling-based inference.

  <h2>Project 2: Multiscale Transport Simulation</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on multiscale numerical methods for radiation transport, neutron diffusion, and Fokker-Planck equations. I aim to build efficient schemes that retain accuracy across scales and can be accelerated using modern GPU and sparse linear solvers.

  <h2>Project 3: Graph-Based Representations of Material Behavior</h2>
  <p>
    I explore how graph neural networks and message passing architectures can represent spatially varying material behavior in simulations, with applications in homogenization, surrogate modeling, and real-time simulation control.

  <h2>Other Research Interests</h2>
  <p>
    Beyond my main projects, I’m interested in broader intersections of computation, applied mathematics, and physical modeling:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Probabilistic numerics and uncertainty-aware simulation</li>
    <li>Bayesian inverse problems in PDE-constrained systems</li>
    <li>Machine learning for physics-informed inference</li>
    <li>High-dimensional approximation and dimensionality reduction</li>
    <li>Scientific software development and reproducibility</li>
  </ul>
